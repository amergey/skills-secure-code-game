## Level 2: Matrix

_You have completed Level 1: Black Friday! Welcome to Level 2: Matrix. :tada:_


### 📝 Storyline

At the time "The Matrix" was first released in 1999, programming was different. In the movie, a computer programmer named Thomas "Neo" Anderson leads the fight in an underground war against powerful computers who have constructed his entire reality with a system called the Matrix. Do you have what it takes to win that war and progress to Level 3?

### :keyboard: What's in the repo?

For each level, you will find the same file structure:

- `code` includes the vulnerable code to be reviewed.
- `hack` exploits the vulnerabilities in `code`. Running `hack.c` will fail initially, your goal is to get this file to pass.
- `hint` offers a hint if you get stuck.
- `tests` contains the unit tests that should still pass after you have implemented your fix.

### 🚦 Time to start!

1. Keep working inside the same environment as in Level 1
1. If you skipped Level 1, go back and follow the 🚦 **Time to start** guide
1. Review the code in `code.h`. Can you spot the bug?
1. Try to fix the bug. Ensure that unit tests are still passing.
1. The level is completed successfully when both `hack.c` and `tests.c` pass. 🟢
1. If you get stuck, read the hint in the `hint.txt` file.
