## Level 1: Black Friday

_Welcome to "Secure Code Game"! :wave:_

### 📝 Storyline

A few days before the massive shopping event Black Friday, an electronics shop without an online presence rushed to create a website to reach a broader customer base. As a result, they spent all their budget on development without investing in security. Do you have what it takes to fix the bug and progress to Level 2?

### :keyboard: What's in the repo?

For each level, you will find the same file structure:

- `code` includes the vulnerable code to be reviewed.
- `hack` exploits the vulnerabilities in `code`. Running `hack.py` will fail initially, your goal is to get this file to pass.
- `hint` offers a hint if you get stuck.
- `tests` contains the unit tests that should still pass after you have implemented your fix.

### 🚦 Time to start!

1. Review the code in `code.py`. Can you spot the bug?
1. Try to fix the bug. Ensure that unit tests are still passing.
1. You successfully completed the level when both `hack.py` and `tests.py` pass 🟢.
1. If you get stuck, read the hint in the `hint.js` file.
