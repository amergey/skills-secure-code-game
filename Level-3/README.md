## Level 3: Social Network

_Nice work finishing Level 2: Matrix! It's now time for Level 3: Social Network. :sparkles:_

### üìù Storyline

The following fictitious story takes place in the mid-2030s. Authorities worldwide have become more digitized. Various governments are adapting social network technology to fight crime. The goal is to establish local communities that foster collaboration by supporting citizens with government-related questions. Other features include profile pictures, hashtags, real-time support in comments, and public tip sharing. Do you have what it takes to secure the social network and progress to Level 4?

### :keyboard: What's in the repo?

For each level, you will find the same file structure:

- `code` includes the vulnerable code to be reviewed.
- `hack` exploits the vulnerabilities in `code`. Running `hack.py` will fail initially, your goal is to get this file to pass.
- `hint` offers a hint if you get stuck.
- `tests` contains the unit tests that should still pass after you have implemented your fix.

### üö¶ Time to start!

1. The codebase generates several code scanning alerts. Your goal is to resolve these alerts for each level.
1. Review the code in `code.py`. Can you spot the bugs?
1. If you get stuck, read the code scanning alert.
1. Try to fix the bug. Make your changes and open a pull request to `main` or push your fix to a branch.
1. Check the tests and the code scanning results to confirm the alert for this level has now disappeared.
