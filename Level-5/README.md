## Level 5: Locanda

_Almost there! One level to go! :heart:_

### üìù Storyline

It's a common myth that passwords should be complex. In reality, it's more important that passwords are long. Some people choose phrases as their passwords. Users should avoid common expressions from movies, books, or songs to safeguard against dictionary attacks. Your password may be strong, but for this exercise, a website you have registered with has made a fatal but quite common mistake. Can you spot and fix the bug? Good luck!

### :keyboard: What's in the repo?

For each level, you will find the same file structure:

- `code` includes the vulnerable code to be reviewed.
- `hack` exploits the vulnerabilities in `code`. Running `hack.py` will fail initially, your goal is to get this file to pass.
- `hint` offers a hint if you get stuck.
- `tests` contains the unit tests that should still pass after you have implemented your fix.

### üö¶ Time to start!

1. The codebase generates several code scanning alerts. Your goal is to resolve these alerts for each level.
1. Review the code in `code.py`. Can you spot the bugs?
1. If you get stuck, read the code scanning alert.
1. Try to fix the bug. Make your changes and open a pull request to `main` or push your fix to a branch.
1. Check the tests and the code scanning results to confirm the alert for this level has now disappeared.
